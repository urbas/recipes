# Mum's potato with garlic and vegeta

- Peal potato, halve into half along the long edge so that you can lay it flat.
- Cut multiple seams into the potato but don't cut it through.
- Cut garlic into thin slices and put it between the slices of the potato.
- You can salt the potato a bit on the top.
- Smear butter all over the baking tray.
- Half of the potato should swim in the water (put more water in there if it
  boils off too much).
- One tablespoon of Vegeta (or vegetable stock) per 200 ml.
