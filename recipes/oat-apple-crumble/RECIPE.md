Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/applecrumble_89166

## Ingredients

    1kg Bramley apples
    pinch sugar, to taste
    1 tbsp water or apple juice
    100g/3½oz plain flour
    75g/2½oz butter
    50g/2oz rolled oats
    100g/3½oz demerara sugar

## Method

Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.

Wipe the apples and cut them into quarters, then remove the cores and slice each
piece in two. Put them into a pan, taste a slice for sweetness and add a
sprinkling of sugar accordingly. Add a tablespoon of water or apple juice and
cook over a medium heat for about five minutes, until the apples start to
soften.

Transfer the apple mixture to a shallow ovenproof pie dish.

Blend the flour and butter in a food processor for a few seconds, until the
mixture looks like breadcrumbs.

Stir in the oats and the brown sugar and sprinkle over the cooked apples in the
pie dish. Transfer to the oven to bake for 30 minutes or until crisp and
golden-brown on top.
